# Static Social Share Buttons

Simple static socials buttons with share count!
I've developed these buttons for my blog: [www.savjee.be](http://savjee.be/2015/01/Creating-static-social-share-buttons/).

Support for Twitter and Facebook buttons. The square version also supports Reddit.

## Demo
There are two versions: traditional and square. This is what they look like:


**Traditional ([Live demo](http://savjee.github.io/static-social-buttons/traditional/index.html)):**
