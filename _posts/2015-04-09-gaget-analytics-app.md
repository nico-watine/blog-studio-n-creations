	<h3>Meet GAget - the last analytics tool you'll ever buy.</h3>
	<h3>Originally a Dashboard Widget, this app has been completely redesigned to now function in the Notification Center. Unfortunately, if you're not running Yosemite 10.10, you're out of luck - that's the only version of OS X this is compatible with. At $1.99, you can't go wrong.</h3>
