<h3>TL;DR <br>
<span class="standard">We highly recommend <a href="https://getflywheel.com/" target="_blank" class="underlined">Flywheel</a> Managed Wordpress hosting.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="margin-bottom">When it comes to managed Wordpress hosting, you're not short of options. "Which host should I go with?" That's a question that every Wordpress-er asks at some point. Hosting companies all vary in site performance and cost, but another important quality that often gets overlooked is customer support. Recently, we had an excellent experience with our latest managed Wordpress hosting company, Flywheel (<a href="https://getflywheel.com/" target="_blank" class="underlined">www.getflywheel.com</a>). Here's what happened.</p>
<p class="margin-bottom">We wanted to create a staging area of a client's website to test a core update before going live with it (as should always be done.) After reading through Flywheel's support forums, we learned that we needed to call a support rep in order to have the staging area set up. Right away that made us uneasy, questioning ourselves over our decision to host with Flywheel. We dialed the support number, expecting to go through a number punch menu for five minutes before getting to speak to a fellow human. We were pleasantly surprised with what actually happened.</p>
<p class="margin-bottom">Dialed the number, listened to the options. "Press 1 to speak with a sales rep. Press 2 to speak with customer support." We pressed 2, and after literally one ring, a human (named Brian) picked up! We told Brian we wanted a staging site, and before we even said why, Brian says, "done." Talk about quick and easy. </p>
<p class="margin-bottom">We asked about the need to call to get the staging area setup. Brian explained that the feature was still in Beta, but that it will soon be made available through the Flywheel hosting account dashboard. It was a perfect customer support experience in every way. We even stayed on the line to take the survery at the end of the call. Tens accross the board.</p>
<p class="margin-bottom">We'll next post about the user experience of the account dashboard, and then the quality of the hosting performance itself. We'll go ahead and say though that we highly recommend <a href="https://getflywheel.com/" target="_blank" class="underlined">Flywheel</a> hosting!</p>
