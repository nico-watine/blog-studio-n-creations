	<h3 class="margin-bottom">Meet GAget - the last Google Analytics tool you'll ever buy.</h3>
	<p>Originally a Dashboard Widget, this app has been completely redesigned to now function in the new Notification Center of Macintosh OS X. Unfortunately, if you're not running Yosemite 10.10 (or newer), you're out of luck - that's the only version of OS X this is compatible with.</p>
	<p>At $1.99, you can't go wrong.</p>
