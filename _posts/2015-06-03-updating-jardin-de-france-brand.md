<h4>Their new store front is up and running, and with great success! With the traffic they are getting, we determined now is the right time to update their online presence and brand. You can see the direction we're going with it with this sample of their new social media profile graphics. If you would like to see how it currently looks, you can <a href="http://www.jardindefrancetx.com" target="_blank">visit their website - www.jardindefrancetx.com.</a></h4>
