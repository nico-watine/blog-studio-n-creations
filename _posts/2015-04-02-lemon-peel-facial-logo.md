	<h3>We designed this logo for Michelle Wright of Lemon Peel Facial. It was inspired by the old version, having a similar layout. The lemon has been updated though to provide a more sophisticated look. Feel free to view it on her site, <a href="http://lemonpeelfacial.com" target="_blank" class="underlined-link">lemonpeelfacial.com</a>. Below is the original logo.</h3>
