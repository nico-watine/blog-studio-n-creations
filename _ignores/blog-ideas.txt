on <aside> side bar, underneath the categories <nav> maybe have the generic Pinterest button to just 'follow' our boards?
on the same note, have a 'like' button via facebook (is that possible?)

optimize studioncreations.com/css/core.css so that it is literally just CORE styes
	this way, the blog isn't downloading extra, unneccesary file styles
	that would require reorganizing SNC SCSS files

create new favicon and icons to represent the new logo look
also create new facebook cover and profile image to use the new white hero on the snc index page
the profile image can either be similar to the new favicons or be like the current style, where it is a continuation of the cover photo

confirm the SNC location registration via the google code that came in the mail
	don't wait to long, this expires at some point i think
