		<p>Website LisaEsposito.com has had many facelifts. At its core, it is a functioning e-commerce store, selling abstract expessionist paintings by Dr. Lisa Esposito. When we first began managing Dr. Esposito's website back in late 2013, it had a large design flaw. The home page featured a prominent slide show, showcasing various paintings. Because of the dimensions of the image slides, when the website was viewed on an iPad, the slide show almost covered the entire screen. This was an issue because the visitor would have to scroll down before being able to preview any of the site's welcoming text.</p>
